    <h1>Final Projects</h1>
  </div>

  <p>
Final projects will be your primary focus (for this class) for the final weeks of the class. 
  </p>
  <p>
Your final project may be either a continuation of one of your earlier game projects (extending, refining, or even radically revising it) or an essay, with potential exceptions noted below. Game projects and essays may be pursued in pairs or individually. If working in a pair, you may choose your own partner, who need not be anyone you have worked with earlier in the class, but should be in your lab section. You must declare whether you are working on a game or essay, and solo or with a partner, by the end of week 8 (and more, as discussed further below).
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Game Projects</h2>
  <a class="anchor" id="game"></a>
  <p>
Final game projects are a way of showing your mastery of class concepts through game building. Final game projects should be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A complete experience, both fully functional and with final text, imagery, and/or sound.</li>
    <li>Building on class concepts through use of resource, linking, and/or graphical logics, in a way the team can articulate.</li>
    <li>Building on class concepts and research into related games to make something innovative in the field.</li>
    <li>Small in scope and clear in concept — explainable in 30 seconds, demoable in 3 minutes, fully playable in under 20 minutes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
The project stages will be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify a project idea, and partner (if any), and a list of related games (to make the case for innovation) by the end of week 8 (Fri. May 22, 11:45 PM).</li>
    <li>Create significantly-improved version of game during week 9, as well as an initial statement of innovation (with comparison to related games). If you have time to begin this before turning in the GameMaker/graphical game analysis, there will be time for feedback in section week 9.</li>
    <li>Bring to section week 10, and upload to eCommons:
      <ul>
	<li>fully-playable “beta” version (all features working),</li>
	<li>prepared presentation of your game (details TBA),</li>
	<li>list of tasks you expect to complete by the end of the week, printed out for section, and</li>
	<li>draft description of project goals, printed out for section, including:
	  <ul>
	    <li>statement of innovation (with comparison to related games) and</li>
	    <li>statement of engagement with different logics.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
      </ul>
    <li>At end of week 10, upload to eCommons:
      <ul>
	<li>the final game,</li>
	<li>instructions for playing the game, and</li>
	<li>description of project goals (including statements of innovation and engagement with different logics).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
As noted above, game projects are expected to be a continuation of one of your earlier game projects — the Tabletop/resource, Twine/link, or GameMaker/graphical project. In exceptional circumstances, it is possible to create a final game project that is not a continuation of one of your earlier projects, and that does not necessarily use one of the tools employed in this class. However, it is necessary for a successful final game to be already started before week 8, and for the person/people creating it to already be familiar with the appropriate tool. So students wishing to pursue this option must show a prototype of their project, in the tool they plan to use, at or before their section meeting week 8. They must receive explicit permission from their TA before declaring a project of this sort.
    </p>
    <p>
A group of final projects will be selected for presentation during the final exam time. The creators of these games will be asked to create a presentation, following a specific format, and will receive extra credit. Some of these games will be selected for presentation at the <a href="https://sammys.soe.ucsc.edu/">Sammy’s</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
Evaluation for this assignment will be based on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether the game operates as intended and described.</li>
      <li>Whether the game is of appropriate scope for a final project (neither trivial nor over-large).</li>
      <li>Whether the assets (e.g., images, text, sounds) used are appropriate to the concept and theme, final (rather than placeholder), appropriately credited (either to the team or their source), and legally used.</li>
      <li>Whether the instructions for playing the game are clear and complete.</li> 
      <li>Whether the description of project goals clearly describes how the game engages class concepts through use of resource, linking, and/or graphical logics (and any additional ones).</li> 
      <li>Whether the description of project goals clearly identifies what makes the game innovative, through comparison with other games.</li>
      <li>To what extent the game succeeds at being engaging and polished, in the manners it intends to be, as outlined in the statement of project goals.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Essay Projects</h2>
    <a class="anchor" id="essay"></a>
    <p>
Final essay projects are a way of showing your mastery of class concepts through analysis and writing. Final essay projects should be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Presenting an idea about games through comparison of at least three specific games.</li> 
      <li>Comparing games both at the system level and the player experience level, using class concepts (with appropriate references).One of these may be a game you created for this class.</li>
      <li>Comparing games from at least two different eras (with appropriate references). 
2,500–5,000 words in length, if a solo essay — or 3,500–5,500 words in length, if writing with a partner (please put word count at top of essay).</li>
      <li>In <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01">MLA format</a> and free of easily-corrected errors. See <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/08/">Works Cited: Electronic Sources</a> for help with formatting game software and online citations.</li>
      <li>A contribution to what we understand about games. You should not write again an essay someone else has already written.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
The project stages will be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify an essay idea, and partner (if any), and a list of comparison games (related to the essay idea) by the end of week 8.</li>
      <li>During week 9, research games and ideas related to yours — and create a detailed outline of the essay, describing each stage of the essay, how it contributes to the overall idea, how it connects to class concepts, and giving the elements of each game that you plan to analyze (at both the system level and the player experience level). If you have time to start this before the GameMaker/graphical game analysis is due, there will be time in section for feedback.</li>
      <li>Bring to section week 10, and upload to eCommons:
	<ul>
	  <li>an initial draft of the essay (at least ⅓ of the essay sections in fully-realized prose), printed out for section,</li>
	  <li>the complete outline you developed week 9, printed out for section, and
a list of the games, critical writing, and any other material you plan to reference, printed out for section.</li>
	</ul>
      <li>At end of week 10, upload to eCommons: the final essay.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
Many types of ideas are appropriate for your essay. You could look at ways some element of life has been presented in games — poverty, war, personal development, empire building, space travel, discrimination, mutation, romance, loyalty, and so on. You could look at the development of a mechanic, structure, genre, or approach over time — technology trees, jumping, linking, football games, MOBAs, election simulations, mission structures, and so on. You could even analyze the work of a particular game creator over time. For example, looking at Richard Evans’s work on AI in <i>Black & White</i>, <i>The Sims 3</i>, and Versu — or Emily Short’s work on dialogue systems in <i>Galatea</i>, <i>Alabaster</i>, and Versu. If you are unsure if your idea is appropriate, please be in touch with your TA as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
Different types of engagement with class concepts are appropriate for your essay. For example, your analysis could use MDA, procedural rhetoric, operational logics, agency, approaches to fiction and theme, or ideas of innovation as lenses — but in any case you want to discuss both how the game operates and what is communicated to players. A number of class concepts already focus on connecting between these levels. For example, we discussed agency as connecting the things the game’s world and fiction suggests doing (“formal affordances”) and the things the game’s system and mechanics support doing (“material affordances”). Similarly, the MDA framework is aimed at describing the connections between the feelings players experience, the available actions and system responses, and the emergent patterns that connect these two. If one of the games you are analyzing is one you created for this class, your earlier analysis assignment should already have connected the game system and player experience, using class concepts — so it can be a good place to start. You can also use concepts not discussed in class (as long as they are appropriately referenced) but you must engage at least one class concept substantially.
    </p>
    <p>
Comparing games from different eras can be accomplished a variety of ways. Perhaps the most obvious is choosing games from before and after a large technological shift. For example, choosing link-based games from the current moment (e.g., Twine games) and from before the spread of the World Wide Web (e.g., Eastgate hyperfictions). Or choosing games from an early console generation (e.g., the Atari VCS) and a recent one (e.g., the PS4). But in any case, please have at least 10 years between the earliest game you analyze and the most recent. It is also <i>highly recommended</i> that you take advantage of the <a href="http://cruzcat.ucsc.edu/search/a?searchtype=m&searcharg=gvd&SORT=D&Submit=go">UCSC library’s game collection</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
Evaluation for this assignment will be based on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether class concepts are engaged, and appropriately referenced.</li>
      <li>The level of understanding demonstrated of class concepts.</li>
      <li>Whether the essay is of appropriate length, with a word count at the top.</li>
      <li>Whether at least three games are compared, from different eras, and appropriately referenced.</li>
      <li>Whether both the system and player experience levels are clearly explained and meaningfully compared. Does the essay use the appropriate techniques (e.g., textual explanations, game screenshots, relationship diagrams) to explain both what each game is doing (in relation to the essay’s idea) and how the games are similar and different (in relation to the essay’s idea)?</li>
      <li>The overall coherence of the idea and its presentation. Is it clear what the essay is about? Does each section make a clearly-identified contribution to that idea? Is the essay internally consistent?</li>
      <li>Whether any ideas originating from others are appropriately identified and referenced. (Failure to do this constitutes <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/help/research/what-is-plagiarism">plagiarism</a> and will, if significant, result in failing the assignment and disciplinary action.)</li>
      <li>The level of polish in the essay’s presentation. Are segues between ideas and sections made smoothly? Are important points in the essay clearly signposted and related to one another? Has the essay been formatted according to MLA guidelines and checked for spelling errors?</li>
    </ul>
