  <h3>Twine/link game team document</h3>
  <a class="anchor" id="teamdoc"></a>

  <p>
Based on your answers to a web questionnaire, we will assign you to a team for this project. Then you will create a team document, each keep a copy of it, and <i>each</i> submit a copy via eCommons. When submitting your list of team names and members, please include all of the following information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name of the team</li>
    <li>Name of each team member</li>
    <li>Your TA and section time</li>
    <li>Two pieces of contact information for each team member, such as an email address or a cell phone number</li>
    <li>Two times during the week when the team can meet for at least one hour</li>
    <li>A location that can be used for meetings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
After submission of this assignment, each team member will be expected to know this information, so you should take this opportunity to add phone numbers to cell phones, email addresses to email applications, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
Evaluation for this assignment will be as follows: If all required information is present, full credit. Otherwise, no credit.

  <h2>Twine/link game project</h2>
  <a class="anchor" id="game"></a>

  <p>
The goal of this assignment is to create a game that emphasizes <i>linking</i>, and that presents a <i>fiction</i> or <i>personal memory</i>.
  </p><p>
As you likely discovered in creating your tabletop/resource game, resources are a powerful way to represent a wide variety of game elements — but there are also significant limitations. Resources are a poor way of representing things such as nuanced life choices, or movements through space, or discussions, or the associative structures of memory. Conversely, these are examples of things that links can do well. 
  </p><p>
And these things that links do well are powerful tools for storytelling. A game structured as a series of choices can move forward propulsively, never letting players turn back (or turn in an uninteresting direction). A game structured around memory’s connections can bring to life the uncertainties, repetitions, and wild leaps we experience when lost in thought. A game of moving through real or metaphorical space, perhaps examining or collecting items, can tell of what came before — like a haunted house or a museum.
  </p><p>
Each of these is a different way of using links. In this class we will talk about them as different approaches to the linking “operational logic.” Your game should use linking in at least two ways — and work to keep those ways of linking distinct, at least for your team as designers and writers, and perhaps also for players. A tutorial you will begin in section introduces some of the different types of links supported by Twine.
  </p><p>
Together with links, you may also choose to employ resources — and perhaps other forms of <i>variables</i>. Moving from one place to another might have a cost, in money or in willpower. Different paths through a discussion might reveal different information, and that information might be required to follow certain future links, or might be tradeable as a resource. Or your player character might have a resource like “will to live” (which ends the game when depleted) or a goal to help three non-player characters (which ends the game when achieved). If you know something about programming, or want to learn, please feel free to — but exclusively using Twine's built-in abilities is fine as well. 
  </p><p>
The first week of this project you will: plan out your complete game, create all the “passages” (nodes in the Twine network, of which you should have more than 30), create the links between them (using at least two well-defined approaches to the linking logic), and “publish” this draft version so it can be uploaded to eCommons. You can write full text for the passages for the first week, but you may only have time for placeholder text, describing what will be in each when completed. During section you will have a chance to playtest this version with peers, as well as get feedback from your TA and/or reader/tutor(s). 
  </p><p>
The second week of this project you will: revise the game based on section feedback, complete the contents of all passages (full text, perhaps with accompanying images), perform at least one playtest with the completed game (and potentially revise based on this) resulting in a playtest report, and upload the final version to eCommons.
  </p>

  <h3>Playtest report</h3>
  <a class="anchor" id="playtest"></a>

  <p>
For this assignment, a playtest report is a document created during or immediately after play of the game. When you turn it in, it should be roughly 500–1000 words long, typewritten. It should include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your team members’ names</li>
    <li>Your team’s name</li>
    <li>Your section time and TA</li>
    <li>Your game’s name</li>
    <li>Who played</li>
    <li>When and where</li>
    <li>How did the player come to understand the different link types?</li>
    <li>Did the player ever get stuck?</li>
    <li>What were some interesting choices players faced at particular moments in the game?</li>
    <li>What were some longer-term strategies players attempted during the game?</li>
    <li>What was the outcome of the game? What other outcomes seemed possible?</li>
    <li>When did the player feel most engaged in the game?</li>
    <li>When did the player feel least engaged in the game?</li>
    <li>How would the player summarize the fiction or memory?</li>
  </ul>

  <p><i>Please submit as a PDF or plain text.</i></p>

  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>
    The assignment requirements are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Week 4:
      <ul>
	<li>Bring a draft game to section, with (1) all passages created (at least 30), (2) all links between them (at least two types), (3) at least placeholder text for all passages, and</li>
	<li>Before section, upload draft game to eCommons (each partner uploads their own copy).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Week 5:
      <ul>
	<li>Bring (1) the final game and (2) a typewritten, printed copy of the playtest report to your section meeting, and</li> 
	<li>Upload (1) the final game and (2) the same playtest report to eCommons before your section meeting (each partner uploads their own copies).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
Evaluation for this assignment will be based on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether all required elements are present.</li>
    <li>Whether the link-focused elements show an understanding of what links do well, and employ different types of links in a complementary fashion.</li>
    <li>Whether the resulting game takes players through appropriate experience shapes (e.g., rising and falling action for a traditional story, mazelike confusion for unreliable memory) to engagingly communicate the fiction or personal memory.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Twine/link game analysis</h2>
  <a class="anchor" id="analysis"></a>
  <p>
The goal of this assignment is to reflect on the structure of your game, as a way of thinking about how games function more broadly. While the other elements of this assignment are done as a team, here your answers are your own (though you are welcome to discuss ideas with your partner, and others, your words should be yours). 
  </p><p>
    Your analysis should include these sections, clearly labeled:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name</li>
    <li>Your team’s name</li>
    <li>Your section time and TA</li>
    <li>Your game’s name</li>
    <li>What fiction or personal memory does your game aim to present? [20–50 words]</li>
    <li>What is the player’s role in your game (e.g., a character, someone shifting the actions of multiple characters, or a disembodied observer)? [20–50 words]</li>
    <li>What different refinements of the linking logic are present in your game? What actions do they enable for the player? [100–150 words]</li>
    <li>What other logics (e.g., resource logics, pattern-matching logics) are employed, if any? What are their roles? How do they connect to your uses of linking logics? [1–150 words]</li>
    <li>What possible shapes does a playthrough of your game have? How do the different shapes relate to player actions through linking (and other) logics? [100–150 words]</li>
    <li>What different conceptions of the fiction or memory, and its meaning, are suggested by the different shapes of possible playthroughs? [100–150 words]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
Evaluation for this assignment will be based on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether all required sections are present, clearly labeled, and roughly at the appropriate length.</li>
    <li>Whether each section shows a clear understanding of the class concepts (from assigned reading, assigned games, and lecture material) appropriate to that section.</li>
    <li>Whether the sections make appropriate connections between each other, demonstrating how individual player actions in your game, enabled by linking (and possibly other) logics, relate to the playthrough shapes and conceptions you aim for players to experience.</li>
  </ul>
