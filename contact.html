    <h3>Questions & Contact</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
<b>Course issues and questions.</b> Questions about course issues and assignments should start at the class forum: <a href="http://piazza.com/ucsc/spring2015/cmpm80k">http://piazza.com/ucsc/spring2015/cmpm080k</a>. (Do not post phone numbers or other personal information to the forums.) First check to see if a question like yours has already been answered. If it has not, and your question does not raise privacy concerns, post it. If you have a question that requires privacy, or if you are not able to get a satisfactory answer through the forums, ask the TA for your section directly. Sending email and coming to office hours are the best routes. If necessary, you can also ask questions during the office hours of one of the other TAs. <br>
      </li>
      <li>
<b>Contact timing.</b> If you have a question about an assignment, please ask at least 48 hours before the assignment is due. With a class this size it isn't possible to answer large amounts of last-minute email, or see a large number of students in the final office hours before a deadline.</li>
      <li>
<b>Contacting the professor.</b> To contact the professor directly, the easiest route is to attend his office hours. Given the large size of the class, please do not email the professor directly unless you have an issue you cannot discuss with your section TA (such as a dispute with your TA). Faculty office hours are kept up-to-date here:

	  <h3>Illness or emergency</h3>
	  <p>
The UCSC health center does not provide medical excuses. In recognition of this, you should simply email your TA before any lecture or lab meeting that you are too ill to attend. Every student, regardless of illness, will have their two clicker quizzes with the lowest grade dropped from the grading process. If you miss more than one quiz due to illness, please contact your TA. Similarly, if an assignment will be unavoidably late due to illness, please contact your TA. The same policies apply for family emergencies, transportation failures, and so on.

	<div class="col-md-6">
	  <h3>Accommodations</h3>
	  <p>
If you qualify for classroom accommodations because of a disability, please get an Accommodation Authorization from the Disability Resource Center (DRC) and submit it to the professor in person outside of class (e.g., office hours) within the first two weeks of the quarter. Contact DRC at 459-2089 (voice), 459-4806 (TTY), or <a href="http://drc.ucsc.edu">http://drc.ucsc.edu</a> for more information on the requirements and/or process.

	  <h3>Academic integrity</h3> 
	  <p>
Of course, academic integrity is expected of all students. Operating another student's clicker is academic dishonesty and will be reported to your college for disciplinary action. All answers on quizzes should come from your memory of course material. All ideas and writing in the analysis assignments and final essay should be yours unless credited to others (and properly cited). All project work presented as yours should be carried out by you. And so on.
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-md-6">
	  <h3>Team problems</h3>
	  <p>
If you are having issues with a project partner, please let your TA know as soon as possible. Learning about working together as a team is an important part of this course â€” and learning isn't always easy. We will do our best to accommodate requests for particular partners, and to avoid particular partners, if they are submitted through the online form. If your partner is not pulling her/his weight, you should let a TA know. We may be able to meet with you to intervene, and we may also be able to do differential grading (which will not be possible if you complain after the class is done).
