  <h3>GameMaker/graphical game team document</h3>
  <a class="anchor" id="teamdoc"></a>

  <p>
Based on your answers to a web questionnaire, we will assign you to a team for this project. Then you will create a team document, each keep a copy of it, and <i>each</i> submit a copy via eCommons. When submitting your list of team names and members, please include all of the following information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name of the team</li>
    <li>Name of each team member</li>
    <li>Your TA and section time</li>
    <li>Two pieces of contact information for each team member, such as an email address or a cell phone number</li>
    <li>Two times during the week when the team can meet for at least one hour</li>
    <li>A location that can be used for meetings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
After submission of this assignment, each team member will be expected to know this information, so you should take this opportunity to add phone numbers to cell phones, email addresses to email applications, etc.
  </p><p>
Evaluation for this assignment will be as follows: If all required information is present, full credit. Otherwise, no credit.

  <h2>GameMaker/graphical game project</h2>
  <a class="anchor" id="game"></a>
  <p>
The goal of this assignment is to create a game that emphasizes <i>graphical logics</i>, and the <i>exploration</i> of an unusual representational or metaphorical space.
  </p><p>
As we will discuss in class, graphical logics (e.g., collision detection, navigation, and physics) are the building blocks of many familiar video games. Games in the tradition of Atari’s <i>Adventure</i> and Nintendo’s Zelda series focus on movement through space and interaction (often through collision) with the objects and characters encountered. These games also often use linking logics to jump from one space to another (e.g., from the above-ground world to a cave) or for character dialogue. They also often use resource logics to track values such as health or for buying and selling items. But graphical logics remain primary.
  </p><p>
These games represent familiar types of space, if often in fantastic settings. If you choose to make a game like this, you should choose a setting and/or goal that is currently unusual for games. It could be an everyday urban street, where the player character interacts with advertising images that sap feelings of self-worth — avoiding them, defacing them, or creating alternatives to them. It could be a set of remote desert canyons, previously used as a dump by neighboring communities, where the player character identifies, collects, and assembles the pieces needed to signal for help before an impending nearby nuclear test. It could be that your player character is an insect, bird, reptile, fish, or non-human mammal, trying to thrive either in their natural environment or another.
  </p><p>
Other graphical logic games present spaces that are primarily metaphorical, rather than representational. This tradition stretches back at least to the 1982 game <i>Tax Avoiders</i>, in which the player character moves around a landscape of financial possibilities. The GameMaker tutorial that you will begin in section presents a metaphorical space of responses to state violence. And of course there are also hybrids: the game <i>Passage</i> is created to be deliberately legible as both a representational and metaphorical space. These games often find ways to have players enact familiar dilemmas and struggles, but in new ways, through graphical logics. 
  </p><p>
We will be using the tool GameMaker for this project, which has built-in support for graphical logics. It also has the ability to be extended, through programming, if you wish to employ types of logics it doesn’t already support. Either approach is fine for this project.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    <a class="smallanchor" id="wk1"></a>
The first week of this project you will: plan out your complete game, implement the types of graphical interactions your game requires, and develop a demonstration game (e.g., a single GameMaker “room”) that shows each type of interaction and your proposed art style. Your plan should outline all the spaces, objects, and interactions planned for the final game, ideally in a combination of text and images. You will bring the demonstration game and plan to section and upload them to eCommons before section.
  </p><p>
The second week of this project you will: build the final version of your game (including all rooms, objects, etc) and playtest it. You will both upload the final game and playtest report to eCommons and bring them to section (with the playtest report typewritten and printed).
  </p>
  <br>
  <h4>Note on “assets”</h4>
  <a class="anchor" id="assets"></a>
  <p>
You do not have to create your own art (or sounds, or words, or code libraries) for your games for this class. But you must have permission to use what you include (either because blanket permission is given, as in the case of Creative Commons licenses, or because you requested and received permission as a team). And you do have to properly credit any game elements that are not your own, in a manner that is unambiguously clear to anyone who might be involved in evaluating your work. 
  </p><p>
A web search should reveal a number of options for sources, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>OpenGameArt.Org <a href="http://opengameart.org/">http://opengameart.org/</a></li>
    <li>The Open Game Art Bundle: <a href="http://open.commonly.cc/">http://open.commonly.cc/</a></li>
    <li>Freesound: <a href="http://www.freesound.org/">http://www.freesound.org/</a></li>
    <li>Free Music Archive: <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">http://freemusicarchive.org/</a></li>
    <li>Project Gutenberg: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">http://www.gutenberg.org/</a></li>
    <li>Extending GameMaker Forum: <a href="http://gmc.yoyogames.com/?showforum=6">http://gmc.yoyogames.com/?showforum=6</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
Please make sure that, whatever source you get game elements from, you are certain of the licensing terms for the specific piece you are using.
  </p>

  <h3>Playtest report</h3>
  <a class="anchor" id="playtest"></a>
  <p>
For this assignment, a playtest report is a document created during or immediately after play of the game. When you turn it in, it should be roughly 500–1000 words long, typewritten. It should include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your team members’ names</li>
    <li>Your team’s name</li>
    <li>Your section time and TA</li>
    <li>Your game’s name</li>
    <li>Who played</li>
    <li>When and where</li>
    <li>How did the player come to understand the different graphical interactions?</li>
    <li>Did the player ever get stuck?</li>
    <li>What were some interesting choices players faced at particular moments in the game?</li>
    <li>What were some longer-term strategies players attempted during the game?</li>
    <li>What was the outcome of the game? What other outcomes seemed possible?</li>
    <li>When did the player feel most engaged in the game?</li>
    <li>When did the player feel least engaged in the game?</li>
    <li>How would the player describe the space and the player character’s role in it?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>
    The assignment requirements are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Week 7:
      <ul>
	<li>Bring to section (1) a complete plan for your game, typewritten and printed, and (2) a demonstration game showing (a) all planned graphical interactions working and (b) the planned art style, and</li>
	<li>Before section, upload (1) game plan and (2) demonstration game to eCommons (each partner uploads their own copies).</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Week 8:
      <ul>
	<li>Bring (1) the final game and (2) a typewritten, printed copy of the playtest report to your section meeting, and</li> 
	<li>Upload (1) the final game and (2) the same playtest report to eCommons before your section meeting (each partner uploads their own copies).</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>
Evaluation for this assignment will be based on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether all required elements are present.</li>
    <li>Whether the parts of the game focused on graphical logics show an understanding of what these logics do well.</li>
    <li>Whether the resulting game effectively enacts the exploration of an unusual representational or metaphorical space.</li>
  </ul>
