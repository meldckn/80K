  <h2>Tabletop/resource game team document</h2>
  <p>
A common source of problems with student teams is lack of communication. To help address this, each team member needs to provide at least two means of communication (such as a cell phone number, or an email address). Another common team coordination problem is not having a common meeting time. To address this, each team must identify two times during the week when it is possible and acceptable for the team to meet for at least one hour.
  </p><p>
Based on your answers to a web questionnaire, we will assign you to a team for this project. Then you will create a team document, each keep a copy of it, and each submit a copy via eCommons. When submitting your list of team names and members, please include all of the following information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name of the team</li>
    <li>Name of each team member</li>
    <li>Your TA and section time</li>
    <li>Two pieces of contact information for each team member, such as an email address or a cell phone number</li>
    <li>Two times during the week when the team can meet for at least one hour</li>
    <li>A location that can be used for meetings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
After submission of this assignment, each team member will be expected to know this information, so you should take this opportunity to add phone numbers to cell phones, email addresses to email applications, etc.
  </p><p>
Evaluation for this assignment will be as follows: If all required information is present, full credit. Otherwise, no credit.

  <h2>Tabletop/resource game project</h2>
  <a class="anchor" id="game"></a>

  <p>
The goal of this assignment is to create a game played with physical materials that can fit on a tabletop (e.g., boards, tiles, cards, counters, dice, charts) with a design that emphasizes resources. 
  </p><p>
The resources can be of many types — such as money, time, political favors, health, labor, military force, willpower, sanity, family members, or prime-time advertising slots. The same game might have a range of resource types, or only one. The resources may be acquired, transformed, destroyed, traded, or dealt with in any other way that works for your game’s theme.
  </p><p>
The theme of each game is the frame through which the game’s resources, and other elements, are presented. For this assignment, your theme must be related to the real world, as your team understands it. Specifically, it must represent a way you think the world is, was, or should be.
  </p><p>
Your game could be about student loans, or Thanksgiving dinners, or the division of nations after the World Wars, or finding balance in life, or religious orthodoxy, or a political campaign, or training a pet, or a child custody battle, or news media reactions to police killing people from different backgrounds. Your game should seek to represent your thoughts about the world in the moment-by-moment actions of the players (e.g., if your game is a turn-based game about avoiding people at parties, with excuses as a resource, every turn should involve thinking about how to gather or use excuses — unless you think it is still possible to get lost in moments of thought or enjoyment, in which case that should also be possible). Similarly, your game should represent your thoughts about the world is in the overall shape of gameplay (e.g., if your game is about washing a child’s hair, with time as a resource, it should not be possible for the hair washing to be done in two minutes, or take all day, no matter how skilled or lucky the players are).
  </p><p>
To complete your game you will probably need some things besides resources — like representational or metaphorical spaces for game pieces to inhabit, or patterns that can be matched, or random events. This is fine, as long as they do not overshadow the resource-focused gameplay.
  </p><p>
In the first week you will create a basic tabletop game that can be played (competitively, cooperatively, single-player, etc) and that works in a way that your team is satisfied with. Along the way to creating it, you will play it, and perhaps invite others to play it — making sure that it offers a range of meaningful choices to each player during most turns, and has a range of meaningful game outcomes. When you think it is done you will create a “playtest report” (see below). You will bring these to section — so that people can play your game, and so that you can get feedback on the in-process design from the TA and/or reader/tutor(s).
  </p><p>
In the second week you will either extend and refine the first week’s game or add “role-playing game” elements to the existing game. We will discuss this further in class.
  </p>

  <h3>Playtest report</h3>
  <a class="anchor" id="playtest"></a>

  <p>
For this assignment, a playtest report is a document created during or immediately after play of the game. When you turn it in, it should be roughly 500–1000 words long, typewritten. It should include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your team members’ names</li>
    <li>Your team’s name</li>
    <li>Your section time and TA</li>
    <li>Your game’s name</li>
    <li>Who played</li>
    <li>When and where</li>

    <li>Did players understand all the rules from the outset? Were any rules difficult to interpret or remember?</li>
    <li>What were some interesting choices players faced at particular moments in the game?</li>
    <li>What were some longer-term strategies players attempted during the game?</li>
    <li>What was the outcome of the game? What other outcomes seemed possible?</li>
    <li>For each player, when did they feel most or least engaged in the game?</li>
    <li>Do any of the players think something different about the game’s theme, based on having played?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>The assignment requirements are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Week 2: 
    <ul>
      <li>Bring (1) a complete draft game and (2) a typewritten, printed copy of the playtest report to your section meeting, and </li>
      <li>Upload (1) the game’s draft rules and (2) the same playtest report to eCommons before your section meeting (each partner uploads their own copies).</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Week 3: 
    <ul>
      <li>Bring the final game to your section meeting, and</li> 
      <li>Upload (1) a photograph of the game and (2) its complete rules to eCommons before your section meeting (each partner uploads their own copies).</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
Evaluation for this assignment will be based on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether all required elements are present.</li>
    <li>Whether the resource-focused elements allow players a range of meaningful actions and provide a range of meaningful game outcomes (or do not, for clearly discernable procedural rhetoric reasons).</li>
    <li>Whether the role-playing elements (if present) broaden the range of actions and/or outcomes, while still leaving an important role for the resource-focused elements.</li>
    <li>Whether the actions and outcomes portray an idea of how the world is, was, or should be — and do so consistently.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tabletop/resource game analysis</h2>
  <a class="anchor" id="analysis"></a>

  <p>
The goal of this assignment is to reflect on the structure of your game, as a way of thinking about how games function more broadly. While the other elements of this assignment are done as a team, here your answers are your own (though you are welcome to discuss ideas with your partner, and others, your words should be yours). 
  </p><p>
Your analysis should include these sections, clearly labeled:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name</li>
    <li>Your team’s name</li>
    <li>Your section time and TA</li>
    <li>Your game’s name</li>
    <li>What about the world (how it is, was, or should be) does your game aim to represent? [20–50 words]</li>
    <li>What actions are available to players, with what potential responses from the game system (i.e., what “mechanics” in the MDA framework)? [100–150 words]</li>
    <li>What patterns arise, during gameplay, from the actions and strategies of players and the responses and other events of the game system (i.e., what “dynamics” in the MDA framework)? [100–150 words]</li>
    <li>What feelings do these patterns evoke, and how do the patterns and feelings change over time for different players (i.e., what “aesthetics” in the MDA framework)? [100–150 words]</li>
    <li>What ideas are communicated through the relationship between these actions, patterns, and feelings — both ones you intended and ones you may not have (i.e., what is the “procedural rhetoric” of your game)? [100–150 words]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
Evaluation for this assignment will be based on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether all required sections are present, clearly labeled, and roughly at the appropriate length.</li>
    <li>Whether each section shows a clear understanding of the class concepts (from assigned reading, assigned games, and lecture material) appropriate to that section.</li>
    <li>Whether the sections make appropriate connections between each other, demonstrating how individual player actions in your game relate to the feelings and ideas you aim for players to experience.</li>
  </ul>
